# SmellyBot v0.02
---
## Introduction
This is SmellyBot, my personal Discord bot that I am working on developing for use within some servers. 
It is currently in early alpha, as I am just learning how to use the Discord API properly. I will be adding features and small little things to this project constantly, albeit slowly, as I do this in my spare time.

## Features
SmellyBot has many features that can be used to spice up your Discord channel. They can be found [here.](https://github.com/SmellyAlex/SmellyBot/wiki/features)

### Commands
SmellyBot has an abundance of commands that can be used, and nobody will be able to remember them all. That's why I've thrown them all together on [this page](https://github.com/SmellyAlex/SmellyBot/wiki/Commands) on the wiki.
