# SmellyBot v0.01
---
## Introduction
This is SmellyBot, my personal Discord bot that I am working on developing for use within some servers. 
It is currently in early alpha, as I am just learning how to use the Discord API properly. I will be adding features and small little things to this project constantly, albeit slowly, as I do this in my spare time.

## Features
Currently SmellyBot has a few basic features that can be used.
- Triggers events in discord and returns messages to keep people informed.
- Rolling random numbers.
- Playing the slot machine with random outcome.

### Commands
- !roll [minimum]-[maximum]
- !slots
- !Hi / !HI / !hi
- !Hello / !HELLO / !hello
- !Dokus / !DOKUS / !dokus
